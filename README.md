# Antennas-GUI
An application that helps with setting antennas azimuths.  
I figure this scritp out during my work in design office, where my duty was to plan first towers and antennas locations. To speed up my work I wrote this.  
Used librabry pyautogui and math.  
Used draft program AutoCAD 2D.  
It includes similar moves accoring coordinates of certain parts of antennas.  
The main inputs are antennas azimuths and their visibility states which are diameters.  
GUI application helps designer to solve the problem about antennas positions on towers, it saves a lot of time.  
Due prevously prepared dynamic blocks and inserted fields in CAD all informations are automatically updating.  
Program creates zones for rotated towers and fits antennas with written azimuths.
